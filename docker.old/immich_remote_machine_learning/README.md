# External Machine Learning Host

For a remote, more powerfull computer to process the machine learning for immich. I am running this on my desktop.

Immich admin > Administration > Machine Learning Settings > URL
Keep the url that is there, and add a new one for the remote server. (the default is `http://immich-machine-learning:3003`)
